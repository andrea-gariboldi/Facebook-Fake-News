## Introduction

**Fake news** has become a significant concern in the digital age, with Social Media platforms being a common breeding ground for the dissemination of **misleading information**. This project focuses on utilizing _machine learning_ algorithms to **detect** and **classify** **fake news articles**, particularly those circulating on _Facebook_.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main subfolders:

- **code**: Contains the source code necessary for the reproduction of the project. This includes any code relevant to the project's functionality.

- **dataset**: Contains the dataset used in the project. The dataset is available for download, enabling users to train and test the models. Detailed information about the dataset can be found in the `dataset` folder.

## Code

The `code` folder contains all the necessary scripts and code for the project. Key files include:

- `Scraper.py`: the script used for scraping the data from the Facebook pages (it uses [facebook-scraper](https://pypi.org/project/facebook-scraper/)).

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific needs.

## Dataset

The `dataset` folder contains the datasets used in the project. You can download the datasets and use them for your experiments. Please review the documentation within the `dataset` folder for information on the dataset's structure.
